# multi-class-classification-using-different-ML-algorithms

The data set is "contraceptive method of choice" and has 1473 records with 9 attributes or variables. the target variable for prediction is "Method". 

The task is to build multiclass classification algorithms using RPart, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest(RF). 

Evaluate the accuracy metrics for predictions to recommend the best algorithm.
